Server
======

Welcome to our bug tracking setup for the Hypixel Creative server. We check this daily looking for major issues and those small bugs. We encourage users to interact with us through the bug reporting system so as to cultivate an immersive user experience with flawless interactions upon full release.

How to Use
==========

To the right side of the page is a small icon that looks like an exclamation point in a circle with a link called "issues", the reports are used to track bugs and feature requests / suggestions. You will receive a number of options on how to label and issue during the reporting process. Bug labels are what we are going to be looking at most and should include things like lack or permissions as compared to the server guide. Enhancement labels are to be used for suggestions or little tweaks we could make to help the server run more efficiently. We ask that when filing a new issue you first look to see if there is already a similar report. The less duplicate reports we receive the more we will be able to get done and improve the server's gameplay experience.
